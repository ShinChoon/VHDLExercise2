**ERROR: (ENCOAX-820):	The OA features are disabled in the current session of Encounter because the oax shared library could not be loaded properly. This could be because your installation was not properly configured. To enable OA features, exit the current session and re-launch Encounter either after fixing your installation by running the Configure Installation phase, or after setting the OA_HOME variable to point to a proper OA installation.

**WARN: (EMS-63):	Message <ENCREPO-102> has exceeded the default message display limit of 20.
To avoid this warning, increase the display limit per unique message by
using the set_message -limit <number> command.
The message limit can be removed by using the set_message -no_limit command.
Note that setting a very large number using the set_message -limit command
or removing the message limit using the set_message -no_limit command can
significantly increase the log file size.
To suppress a message, use the set_message -suppress command.
