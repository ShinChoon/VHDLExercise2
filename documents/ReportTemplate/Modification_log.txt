    I also suggest, that we put all the texfiles directly under the main
    directory. I see no reason to build directory hierarchy for single files. If
    naming hierarchy is needed, that can be created by naming conventions.

    I suggest, that all the Figures go to the Figures. You may use whatever
    methods you like to include them in your latex files.

    The conversion script "makearticle" in this directory can be used directly to
    compile the latex files. It also cleans up all the intermediate files

    Use ./makearticle -p <mastertexfile> for pdflatex. ./makearticle -h gives help
    Output is in "pdffiles" directory.
