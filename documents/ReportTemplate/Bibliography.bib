  abstract = {We present a 2.4-GHz asymmetric multilevel outphasing (AMO) power
	amplifier (PA) with class-E branch amplifiers and discrete supply
	modulators integrated in a 65-nm CMOS process. AMO PAs achieve improved
	modulation bandwidth and efficiency over envelope tracking (ET) PAs
	by replacing the continuous supply modulator with a discrete supply
	modulator implemented with a fast digital switching network. Outphasing
	modulation is used to provide the required fine output envelope control.
	The AMO PA delivers 27.7-dBm peak output power with 45% system efficiency
	at 2.4 GHz. For a 20-MHz WLAN OFDM signal with 7.5-dB PAPR, the AMO
	PA achieves a drain efficiency of 31.9% and a system efficiency of
	27.6% with an EVM of 2.7% rms.},
