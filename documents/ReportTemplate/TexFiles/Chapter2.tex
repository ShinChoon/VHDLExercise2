\section{30th May: Synthesis report}
During the syntehsis, I browsed the report about Power, Constraints and Timing path.

Especially in timing report, there are max 10 worst paths in the design which provides direction
to optimize the logic behind.
5 out of 10 paths are related to PC\_tot[1](configuration) and fsmPC(from bit 7 to bit 3) in FSM, which is the signal to count PC.
Other 5 paths starts from instr\_wr to resultOutMem in FSM. Definitly it should happen when the test process switch the instr\_wr from reading mode
to calulcation mode.
Besides, I still have two latches  on the resultOutMem\_reg and resultOutReg\_reg. These are output port of FSM
to the RAM or register W. The result input will be assigned to one of them depending on the value of output selector which is judged 
by the instrction type. I havn't find the way avoid this latch without calcaulation errors on result. So I decided to keep them because
the correct behaviour of circuit is the first priority instead of reliability. 

\section{30th May: Formality history}
The formality alets that some signals are not in the part of process sensitivity list such as ``current\_state'', ``Instruction'',``fsmPC'' and so on.
These are the internal signals I used in two synchronous process. It is because I want to simply the FSM process strucure by dividing it into
two processes. One is for assigning output select and reading\_writing mode switch, another one is for executing other assignments in specific status.
So I decided to add them only into process sensitivity list.

\section{30th May: Static timing synthesis report}
I browsed the setup\_viol report, and found these paths with violations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item FE\_PHC6961\_DUT3\_N359  : input\_select in FSM,  actua transition takes 0.32
    \item DUT2\_instruction\_array\_1844 : instruction array in RAM, actual transition takes 0.29
\end{enumerate}

In hold\_vio report, the violoated pin and the transition are the same as in setup. 
And the check report for setup is indicating that the wost paths on timing are the same as in DC analysis.
8 out of 10 are related to the path from PC\_tot to FMS's fsmPC signal.  Other two are related to the path from
instr\_wr to resultOutMme.
Differently in check report for hold phase, seven critial paths are starting from the RAM's signal ``insruction\_array'' to itself, 2 are starting from RAM's output port ``d\_out'' 
 to itself, which is confusing. 
One is in FSM, from ``insturction\_type'' to ``o\_select''(output selector), which is understandable.


The power report for hold and setup session are not visiable becasue the site is not licensed for `PrimeTime-PX'
so it cannot proceed without power anaysis feature.
